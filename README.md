# Yog4Life - The Art Of Living
## The problem Yog4Life solves
### ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
 * 9.4% of children aged 3-17 years (approximately 5.8 million) had been diagnosed with anxiety in 2016-2019.
 * 4.4% of children aged 3-17 years (approximately 2.7 million) have been diagnosed with depression in 2016-2019.
 * This inspired us to create a functional application that would be able to help those struggling with anxiety in their day-to-day life.
 * Experts believe yoga helps with anxiety by reducing levels of stress hormones in the body. So we are trying to make an app for helping people their healthy life. Yoga4Life Has a feed feature which is help to get information from the folks, Yoga4Life has an anonymous chat room to get connected with the world.

### ðŸ’» What it does
1. Create a post with photos and context
2. Browse Posts
3. Anonymous chat room
4. View user profile
5. Passwordless login with OTP

### Technologies 
#### Hedera HashGraph
* We are using Hederaâ€™s testnet to deploy smart contracts for our app. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications

#### IPFS and Estuary(Filecoin)
* We are using estuary to upload public images onto Filecoin and pin it to IPFS. The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol, hypermedia, and file-sharing peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting IPFS hosts.

### Challenges we ran into
- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project by a deadline.
- As we are new to IPFS/Filecoin/estuary we face problems in getting the content properly with minimum lag.
- Using hedera for developing the anonymous chat room was time-consuming as we are new to web3 but having JS SDK was a bit easier.
- As Flutter is a new framework finding solutions for some problems was bit difficult compared to JS
